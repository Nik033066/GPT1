discover and understand how large language models work internally, as a foundation for AI safety and positive outcomes.\n\nThe Alignment team works to understand the risks of AI models and develop ways to ensure that future ones remain helpful, honest, and harmless.\n\nWorking closely with the Anthropic Policy and Safeguards teams, Societal Impacts is a technical research team that explores how AI is used in the real world.\n\nThe Frontier Red Team analyzes the implications of frontier AI models for cybersecurity, biosecurity, and autonomous systems.\n\n[IMAGE: Video thumbnail]\n\nPolicyDec
